# Coherence Arcana

**Coherence Arcana** is a single-player, quantum-themed strategic card game where you build fragile quantum circuits before reality collapses.
Arrange qubits, apply quantum gates, and maintain coherence as long as possible — every move brings you closer to quantum perfection… or noisy chaos.

## Gameplay Overview

You start with a deck of **Qubits, Gates, Measurements, Artifacts** cards.
Your goal: build the most coherent, high-scoring quantum circuit before the **Decoherence Meter** fills up.
